============ Python ================

# The GotoButtons need to be their own class in the Python Writer so the chapter script can fix the links

# Check alignments on complicated spans 

============ Flutter ================

# GotoButtons (Flutter) need to look like buttons
	-need to disable the link (with visual indication) when the link is null / not found 

Standardize font files (futura is wacky, rubik is wacky, etc)
	- some of it may be weights 

Put search bar into list (so it scrolls under)

============ Book ================

Door Signs (in general) should be a different color 

# Call ahead 

Move activities after BusTrip label 

# T-shirts
Needs to say the date 

Add Header title before Indica's introduced 
Nick yelled -> Nick yelped 

# Manilla 

Move manilla envelope to rest of Rachel's conversation 

# Remove god's perfect marijuana 

#RFK 

This left-align text is not going to work. 


============ Medium ===============

- TabSpan (CustomLayout. needs absolute position. google whether it's already been done. Might need SpanThatHoldsTabs.) 
	( what for?? ) 

- Python Microservice for comments 
	add_comment(string, box_id) // adds comment to set 
	get_comments(box_id, n) //returns n random comments  
	Remove n word 


============ Large ================

- Chapters need to announce to book what fonts are used 
- ReaderScreen needs to ask elements whether it can continue.

- Font types (blocking, non-reloading.)
	Blocking: Gator font. Waits for ModernThrash to arrive before displaying any further elements. 
	Non-reloading: If font is not ready when shown, it falls back to Palatino/Garamond/third (chosen manually during font_counter) and does not reload. 
	
- Use dynamic_cached_fonts package
